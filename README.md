### Description

The Idea for The Photo Sharing App was to simulate the environment that a social media can have. In this case we are talking about being able to upload/take a picture and share it with all the users that you are following. We are going to build other features like commenting and liking a picture that was posted, and a photo editing page.

I made this project to practice making a full stack app. You can check how the project evolved in the rest of the Readme.I made this project my self combining what I've learned with a few blog post. I added my wire frames and my data model. This project has been created and implemented by following a TDD strategy (as much as I could)

### Final thoughts

**A final overview...:**

- 👨🏽‍💻 I worked endless hours the past weeks to deliver this project at the current state. The idea was above and beyond my level of coding at the time i started, but hard work and lot of study delivered a piece of my overall idea which is very presentable and i am very proud of it!
- 🌱 Uploading and taking pictures gave me a hard time at first but after working around it i realized how powerful is and great how to implement this feature.
- 💬 Ask me about anything about the project, I am happy to chat with people or even collaborate.
